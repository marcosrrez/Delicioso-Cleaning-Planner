# Delicioso Cleaning Planner 🎨✨

An ADHD-friendly, color-coded printable cleaning suite designed to reduce overwhelm and maximize dopamine.

## 🧠 The Science Behind the Design
This planner isn't just a list; it's a cognitive support tool.
- **Zone Coding:** Uses specific colors to group tasks by room, reducing the mental energy required to "context switch."
- **Low-Demand Entry:** Features "Bare Minimum" daily tasks to maintain momentum on low-energy days.
- **Visual Clarity:** High whitespace and rounded typography (`Quicksand`) to minimize visual anxiety.
- **Dopamine Markers:** Oversized checkboxes for satisfying completion feedback.
